# Railway API Error Fix - Status "ERROR" Issue

## Problem Identified
The Railway yt-dlp API was returning "ERROR" status consistently, but the Knowledge Bot client was treating "ERROR" as an unknown status and continuing to poll indefinitely, causing the bot to hang.

## Root Cause
The original code only handled specific statuses:
- ‚úÖ `completed` ‚Üí Success
- ‚ùå `failed` ‚Üí Error  
- üîÑ `pending`, `processing` ‚Üí Continue polling
- ‚ùì Anything else ‚Üí **Treated as unknown, kept polling**

The Railway API was returning `ERROR` (uppercase), which wasn't explicitly handled as a failure case.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Status Handling**
Updated `services/railway_client.py` to properly handle error statuses:
```python
elif status in ["failed", "error", "ERROR"]:
    # Extract detailed error information
    # Stop polling and raise appropriate error
```

### 2. **Enhanced Error Reporting**
- Extract error details from multiple possible fields (`error`, `message`, `stderr`, etc.)
- Provide specific error messages based on error type (URL issues, private videos, service errors)
- Added debug logging for full error responses

### 3. **Improved User Experience**
Updated `bot/handlers/video_handler.py` with better error messages:
- "Video not found or unavailable" for URL issues
- "This video is private" for private content
- "Download service temporarily unavailable" for service errors

### 4. **Added Health Check**
Added optional Railway API health check to detect service issues early.

### 5. **Better Logging**
- More detailed status logging with progress information
- Success/failure logging with attempt counts
- Debug information for troubleshooting

## Status Handling Matrix

| Status | Action | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `completed` | ‚úÖ Return result | Download successful |
| `failed`, `error`, `ERROR` | ‚ùå Raise error | Download failed - stop polling |
| `pending`, `processing`, `running`, `downloading`, `extracting`, `queued` | üîÑ Continue polling | Download in progress |
| Unknown status | ‚ö†Ô∏è Continue with warning | Graceful degradation |

## Files Modified
1. `services/railway_client.py` - Fixed error status handling
2. `bot/handlers/video_handler.py` - Better user error messages  
3. `debug_railway.py` - Created debugging tool

## Testing
The bot will now:
- ‚úÖ Properly detect Railway API failures
- ‚úÖ Stop polling when ERROR status is received  
- ‚úÖ Provide informative error messages to users
- ‚úÖ Log detailed error information for debugging

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Railway API responses to identify specific error causes
2. Consider implementing fallback video download methods if Railway continues to have issues
3. Add Railway API status monitoring/alerting
