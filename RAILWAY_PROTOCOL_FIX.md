# Railway File Download Protocol Fix 🔗

## Problem Identified ✅

The Railway yt-dlp service integration was working perfectly until the file download step:

### ✅ Working Parts:
1. **API Communication**: Perfect ✅
2. **Status Polling**: `QUEUED` → `RUNNING` → `DONE` ✅  
3. **Download Success**: Railway downloaded the TikTok video ✅
4. **Response Format**: All fields returned correctly ✅

### ❌ The Issue:
The `file_url` returned by Railway API was missing the protocol:

**Returned by Railway:**
```
"file_url": "railway-yt-dlp-service-production.up.railway.app/files/videos/..."
```

**Expected by httpx:**
```
"https://railway-yt-dlp-service-production.up.railway.app/files/videos/..."
```

### 🎯 Root Cause:
Railway's response didn't include `https://` prefix, causing:
```
ERROR: Request URL is missing an 'http://' or 'https://' protocol.
```

## Solution Implemented 🛠️

Added automatic protocol prefix detection in the Knowledge Bot:

```python
# Ensure file_url has proper protocol
if not file_url.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
    file_url = f"https://{file_url}"
```

### How It Works:
1. Check if URL already has `http://` or `https://`
2. If missing, prepend `https://` 
3. Download file with complete URL

## Test Results Expected 🚀

The download flow should now work completely:

1. ✅ Send URL to Railway → `QUEUED`
2. ✅ Poll status → `RUNNING`  
3. ✅ Railway downloads video → `DONE`
4. ✅ Get `file_url` from Railway
5. ✅ **Fix protocol prefix** → `https://railway-yt-dlp-service...`
6. ✅ Download file to temp directory
7. ✅ Analyze with Gemini
8. ✅ Enrich with Claude  
9. ✅ Save to knowledge base
